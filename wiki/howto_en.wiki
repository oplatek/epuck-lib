    = How to run a programu using e-Puck and the Elib library=
    ==Requirements and features==
    * E-puck with charged accumulator
    * Bluetooth
    * Computer with .Net Runtimem 2.0 and above. Elib can be used in every .Net language.
    * OR Computer with Mono under Linux(or other OS)
    * Library is in the first place deployed for .Net in MS Visual Solution 2008.
    But don't be afraid to tell me if you need up-to-date MSVS Solution 2005 or Mono Developed solution.         
    * Elib is C# library and all examples are written in C#. Threfore is handy to know some C++ like language.

    =Simple guide=
    * Install your Bluetooth device. Download and extract library Elib for Linux or Windows.
    * Turn on e-Puck and Bluetooth. Pair computer and e-Pucka. A pin code for Bluetooth can be found on label on e-Puck's body. 
    * Open folder My Bluetooth places and choose Serial connections. Windows will connect to e-Puck using some port e.g "COM4". 
    You can find it out clicking with a right mouse button on the serial connection icon. 
    * Open the unzipped MSVS 2008 solution. (Visual Studio 2008 or above is needed). There are two projects, which you can see in solution explorer in Visual Studio.       
    First is Elib library and second is console application TestElib.
    * Change port according your serial connections e.g. from "COM4" to "COM3".
    * Open Program.cs from TestElib in Solution explorer and uncomment "\\Examples.TestPort();".    * Move your mouse above Examples.TestPort() and click on right button and select Go to definition. After that an editor jumps to body of  Examples.TestPort() method 
    * We are going to test the robot if it is ready. Press Ctrl+F5, which will run the console application TestElib.
    If everything is ok, the e-Puck moves a little.
    * If e-Puck is connected and the TestPort() function runs in TestElib, so the orange LED near the switch sould be turn on.   
    If you can't run this example, try pair the e-Puck and connect the serial connection again. Give a special care changing the port string
    in main TestElib function. Under Windows port names are e.g COM1,..,COM3,.. Under linux the names look like /dev/rfcomm0,..,/dev/rfcomm2.
    * Check out other functions in class Elib.Examples. They show different usage of elib on simple examples.
    * TestElib project is ready for you to develop your own application, because all needed references and "using" keywords have been included.
