\chapter{Introduction}
	The mobile robotics is nowadays prestigious research area and building a highly functional mobile robot is considered difficult. Not only it is considered difficult, it is fascinating process, which
	involves a lot of engineering disciplines.
	\\
	The processing power of microchips has grown more than ten times in last decade. Large variety of different sensors are available on the market.	
	A lot of cheap and sufficient components result in boom of simple robots used in daily life. 
	Lawnmowers and vacuum cleaners are typical examples of mobile robots invasion into our households in these days.
	We also have used to robot prototypes in space or in army, which are highly specialized.
	Despite rapid hardware development and robots increasing popularity,
	 research on the field of mobile robots is at its beginning. 
	\\
	Big problem for starting students of mobile robotics is its complexness. Many of them are discouraged by
	studying hardware  details due to building a robot before writing even a simple algorithm.
	Luckily several educational robots were made to overcome the initial complexity problem of building a robot.	
	The present work describes and implements a library for one of educational robots.
	It is called e-Puck and it is a great example of an educational robot for students at university level. 
	\\
	E-Puck has clean, simple and robust mechanical design, which is easy to understand.
	Two differential stepper motors facilitate a precise movement. Camera, eight infra red (IR) sensors,
	accelerometer, encoders and three microphones is enough for robot to feel the real world its sensors.
	E-puck can react to perception with a light from light emitting diodes (LEDs), playing
	a sound or of course movement produced by motors.
	\\
	E-puck has eight red LEDs on its perimeter, four of green LEDs are placed in its translucent body and
	one stronger front LED is located next to the camera. The front LED illuminates a terrain in front of e-Puck to
	take better pictures from the camera. The rest of LEDs together with speaker are usually used to
	generate feedback. Bluetooth enables sending data between e-Puck and PC.
	\\
	E-puck allows students to solve a large scale of problem from a field of mobile robotics thanks to 
	large variety of sensors and actuators. On the other hand a processing power of e-Puck does not allow to 
	process all outputs from its sensors. For example resolution from e-Pucks camera is 640*480 pixels
	 and pictures taken from camera are trimmed under 50*50 pixels, because there is a lack of space in 
	 e-Puck's microchip's memory.
	 \\
	 E-puck robot and its sensors and actuators can be controlled only by low level C code,
	  which needs to be downloaded to e-Puck's memory and it has to be run by robot's microchip.
	 On the other hand a program downloaded to e-Puck can intermediate communication between 
	 PC and sensors and actuators on robot. 
	 The program has to define a protocol, in which it communicates between e-Puck and PC over Bluetooth.
	On e-Puck such program exists and is called BTCom. 
	BTCom is published under open source licence with e-Puck.
	Programming e-Puck microchip needs knowledge of sensors and actuators interfaces.
	Furthermore debugging options are limited to blinking with diodes or playing sounds.
	This reasons and not sufficient processing power hinder rapid development of even a simple program 
	and it makes e-Puck programming inconvenient for students.
	\\
	At the time of writing this thesis, there is only one well developed software for e-Puck called Webots,
	which makes programming e-Puck easier.
	Webots is great developing and simulation environment, but it is commercial software 
	and the fees need to be paid every year.
	Other simulators, which could be alternative for e-Puck, are introduced in chapter two. %todo
	\\
	The drawbacks of low level programming are removed by present Elib library, 
	which uses BTCom program on e-Puck.
	Elib library runs on PC and communicates with the robot via Bluetooth. 
	A program, which uses Elib library,	makes an e-Puck a carrier of sensors and it only gives e-Puck 	
	commands to change state of its actuators, but a whole algorithmic code runs on PC.
	\\
%	The attitude, which is introduced in the library, solves the problem with lack of processing power, because
%	the algorithm runs on PC, which is much stronger. Debugging tools and programmers comfort are improved,
%	because Elib is written in C#. C# is high level object-oriented programming language and there are two high quality
%	 integrated developments environment free available. MonoDeveloped is o
	On the other hand the attitude of Elib brings new problems.
	Present thesis is introducing the problems and benefits of Elib approach and argues 
	whether this attitude pays off or not.
