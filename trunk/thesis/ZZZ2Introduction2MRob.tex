\chapter{Introduction to mobile robotics}
	Mankind always created tools to make easier its job. 
	Even the word "robot", first used by Karel Capek in a novel RUR published in 1920, came from world "robota", which in Czech means labour.
	\\
	Mobile robots are useful in many areas. Nowadays robots excel in exploration of danger places. For example rover Spirit and Delta II flew to Mars.
		%todo picture spirit_rover.jpg
	Delta II is a spacerocket. It is not considered a typical robot, although it has lot of sensors and very strong motor. Rockets like Delta II allows humanity explore so distant places,
	that is impossible for a man to travel there in one man life.	
	On the other hand Spirit is a robot of our image. It is a six wheel robot, which is similar to police robots for bomb manipulation.
	\\
	Mobile robots are not narrow specialized in adventurous actions and impossible missions. Their main contribution is in a daily life.
	In many cities of the world the robots are used in public transport. They drive the trains in subway,
	help the pilot to take off or land with a plane. They are used to park a car or they control the cruise control.
	Robots are widely used just to help people with difficult task, but people likes having things under control and
	therefore robots for parking a car can be easily turned off.
	\\
	On the other hand the research in mobile robotics try to produce robots, which are absolutely autonomous and which do not rely
	on human help. The developers take all responsibility for a robot, which is particularly hobbling, if the robot interacts with people. 
	There are areas, where the industry already succeed.
	\\
	Autonomous lawnmowers and vacuum cleaners are broadly used in households and in garden and no one has a fear from them.
	Also a many robotic toys has been introduced.

	A robotic dog Aibo introduced in 1999 is a nice example of a toy robot.
	\\
	Not only entertainment robots are design for human-robot interaction. In Japan is a big stress 
	on creating	robots for health care, which will compensate lack of medical personnel. 
	The robots has to be a humanoid, because especially young and old people are used to 
	communicate with other people and not with machines.
	\\
	Big success in field of humanoid robots reached professor Hiroshi Ishiguro, 
	which created several generations of humanoid robots.
	He made a copy of himself and his daughter.
	The last generation of robots are so similar to human, that are almost unrecognisable.
	Hiroshi Ishiguro is concentrating on simulating human behaviour, speech and motion, 
	but he also invented a touch sensor,
	which on his robots substitutes human skin.
	%todo picture of ishigoro_clone.jpg
	\\
	The humanoid robots and also the Aibo robot are not wheeled robots, although wheeled 
	robot systems are still	dominating. The reason is in field of activity of robot. 
	The entertainment and the health care robots are in human environment, 
	where are a lot of stairs and different obstacles.
	The industrial robots are usually indoors, where the terrain is adapted to machines movement. 
	Also the agricultural robots has convenient conditions for a wheel movement.
	\\
	Not only the design of robots, but also the control of robots differs and evolves.
	\\
	At the eighties the sense-plan-act model was actual.
	Later in the nighties the behaviour model was introduced by Brooks,
	which was a very modern and sometimes strictly implemented.	
	After a decade a compromise between behaviour based robotics and simple planning was popular.
	In nighties was also firstly introduced neural networks and other modern, biologically motivated attitudes.
	Genetic algorithms and neural networks has enormous success in complicated control problems e.q motion of
	robot with many legs, implementing very sophisticated behaviour and so on.
	\\
	Because a robot is based on information from sensors and possibilities of actuators,
	development of sensor processing and for example motion control, has direct impact to
	quality of robots behaviour.
	\\
	To conclude, mobile robotics is dynamically evolving science,
	which has all the precondition to be one of the leading research area in twenty first century.
	Value of the market increased to 6.2 billion dollars in year 2009 according International Federation of Robotics.
